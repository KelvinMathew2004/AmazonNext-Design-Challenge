# AmazonNEXT 2025 Design Challenge ‚Äì Team Artemis  
**Project:** *From Pixel to Plate: Smarter Grocery Planning*  
**Team Members:** Vaidic Soni ‚Ä¢ Kelvin Mathew ‚Ä¢ Priyanka Karki  

---

## üìñ About the Project  
We redesigned **Flipp**, a popular price comparison and digital shopping assistant, to better serve **SNAP/EBT recipients, budget-conscious shoppers, and time-constrained individuals**. Our goal was to transform Flipp into an **inclusive grocery planning platform** that enables smarter comparisons, supports government benefit users, and empowers communities through collaboration.  

---

## üí° Problem  
- Existing platforms (Flipp, Walmart, Instacart) lack reliable **SNAP/EBT eligibility filters**  
- Users face **checkout surprises** when items marked eligible turn out not to be  
- Manual comparison of **prices, fees, and substitutions** wastes time and money  
- No collaborative system for users to correct or contribute eligibility and discount information  

---

## ‚úÖ Solution  
Our redesign introduces:  
- **SNAP/EBT Support** ‚Äì Eligibility filters, tags, and collaborative corrections  
- **Cart Comparison** ‚Äì Compare totals across in-store, curbside, and delivery (with fees)  
- **Smart Modes** ‚Äì Flexible shopping options with preferences (substitutions, sustainability)  
- **Community Collaboration** ‚Äì Users verify SNAP tags, flag errors, and share deals  
- **Save & Checkout** ‚Äì Affiliate-ready shopping plans, saved lists, and purchase reminders
